feat: complete authentication system with admin user management

## Authentication & User Management
- User registration with email OTP verification
- 4-step onboarding: register → verify email → upload KYC → login
- JWT authentication with 7-day expiration
- Session management with database validation
- Secure logout with token blacklisting
- Password reset with OTP verification (min 8 chars)

## Profile Management
- Single PUT endpoint for flexible updates (name, phone, photo)
- Multipart form-data support for optional fields
- Profile photos stored in Supabase Storage (10MB max, JPG/PNG)
- Account deletion with password confirmation

## Admin User Management
- Block/suspend users (prevents login and API access)
- Unblock/reactivate users (restores full access)
- Force logout users from all devices
- Delete users (hard delete or soft delete)
- List and view user details
- All actions logged in audit trail

## Security Enhancements
- Account status validation on every API request
- Blocked users cannot login or access any endpoint
- Session validation checks database on each request
- Token blacklisting prevents use after logout
- Password verification for account deletion
- Generic messages in password reset (prevent email enumeration)
- File type and size validation

## Database Changes
- Added profile_photo_url column to users table
- Created admin_actions table for audit logging
- Migrations: 
  - 1700000000001-AddProfilePhotoToUsers
  - 1700000000002-CreateAdminActionsTable
- Created AdminAction entity

## API Improvements
- Consistent response format across all endpoints
- Web-app friendly login response with organized data
- Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 500)
- Clear error messages for blocked/suspended accounts
- Comprehensive error handling

## Storage Integration
- Supabase Storage for profile photos and KYC documents
- Organized file structure by userId
- Public URLs for immediate access
- Service role key for backend operations
- Separate buckets: kyc-documents, profile-photos

## Technical Fixes
- Fixed static method call in AuthController (this → AuthController)
- Enhanced auth middleware with account status check
- Updated User model with updateProfile method
- Extended SupabaseStorageService for profile photos
- Admin audit logging with PgAuditRepository

## Documentation
