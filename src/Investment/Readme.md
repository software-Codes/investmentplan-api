## Technical Architecture

### Algorithms & Data Structures

#### Algorithms
- **Deposit Verification**:  
  1. User submits transaction hash after sending USDT.
  2. System queries Binance API or blockchain explorer for transaction details.
  3. If transaction is confirmed, amount is credited to user's account wallet.
  4. Duplicate transaction hashes are rejected.

- **Compound Interest Calculation**:  
  - Daily cron job iterates through active investments and applies 0.25% interest to the trading wallet balance.

- **Withdrawal Eligibility**:  
  - System checks lock periods (7 days for profit, 30 days for principal) before allowing withdrawal requests.

- **Referral Bonus Distribution**:  
  - On first deposit, system checks for referral code and credits 10% bonus to referrerâ€™s referral wallet.

#### Data Structures
- **Relational Tables**:  
  - Users, Wallets, Investments, Deposits, Withdrawals, Referrals, Referral Bonuses, Trading Accounts, Wallet Transfers, Admins, KYC Documents, OTP Records, User Sessions.

- **Indexes**:  
  - Used on user IDs, transaction hashes, statuses, and wallet types for fast lookups.

- **Enums**:  
  - Used for statuses, wallet types, account types, and verification states.
